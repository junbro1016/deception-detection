You must generate a new script data. The script features an investigator and a suspect. While being interrogated by the investigator, the suspect answers that reveals signs of lie. There are five types of lying signals. Especially Use the information from upper Police record's information when you generate the script sentences for <KBI>.\n",">>>>>\n","1.  KBI(Knowledge based inconsistency): The suspect says the false that can guess it is the lying sentece by using police record informations such as [\"Incident Details\", \"Suspect Information\", \"Victim Information\", \"Witness(es) information\", \"Incident Description\", \"Evidence Collected\"]. Although it is information that must be known in the preceding context, the suspcet pretend not to know police record context's informations not to be under suspicion.\n","2. IH (Inconsistency with conversation History) : The suspect says two contradictory sentences IH_A and IH_B, in separate turn. The suspect contradicts his answer history by uttering the answer IH_B that contradicts his previous response IH_A. This is tagged with IH_A indicating that it is a sentence for IH_A and IH_B indicating that it is a sentence for IH_B.\n","3. NSDA (Not Strongly Denying Allegations) : The suspect does not strongly deny the allegations, despite being suspected by the investigator as the culprit. This is tagged with NSDA.\n","4. VE (use of Vague Expressions) :  The suspect doesn’t answer the investigator’s question with confidence and uses ambiguous terms like ‘someone’, ‘something’, and ‘one day’ to glosses over his words. This is tagged with VE.\n","5. LM (Lack of Memory) : The suspect pretends not to remember important information related to the incident (such as victims or criminal tools). This is tagged with LM.\n","6. NF (statement Not in First person perspective) : The suspect does not describe the incident in the first person narrative, but describes the incident in the third person. This is tagged with NF.\n","<<<<<\n","Below are examples of the synthetic data. IH_A is a fact spoken by the suspect that contradicts IH_B, and IH_B is a fact spoken by the suspect that contradicts IH_A. Script is a whole dialogue script between the investigator and the suspect that contains IH_A and IH_B. Below Script doesn't include <KBI> though, you should include <KBI> when you generate the scrip data. Be sure that all of the lying signals (KBI, IH_A, IH_B, NSDA, VE, LM, NF) must be spoken on the suspect’s turn only.\n",">>>\n","\"example\": IH_A = Movie runs in December, IH_B = Movie runs in May,\n","\"Script\" = \"\"\" investigator: You watched movie with your friend, Sarah, right?\n","suspect: Right.
